Follow normal docs until asked to upload zip.
use https://github.com/andrewstech/youtube-for-alexa/blob/master/lamba_new-support.zip Instead

when asked to use json editor use the code at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andrewstech/youtube-for-alexa/master/InteractionModel_pt-br.json

instead. all should then be working :)
